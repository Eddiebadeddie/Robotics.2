To compile the Wavefront map, use g++ Wavefront.cpp and run
the executable. If you have different test files, you can 
run the executable with the argument of the path to the
test file. For instance, if you have the data in file
test.txt, after compiling the program, you can run 
"./a.exe test.txt" and the program will pull the data from
"test.txt". The data is stored to Wavefront.txt
